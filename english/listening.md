### Moon Landing
1. `But there is compeling reason in favor of another moon landing, which try to pinpoint the age of the moon.`

But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing, **not the least of which** is trying to **pinpoint** the moon's age.

2. We could do this in theory, known as South pole basin.

=> We could do this **in theory** by studying an **enormous** **impact crater**, known as the **South Pole-Aitken Basin**.

3. But since it's far side of the Moon, it can only be seen from the space

=> But since it's **on the** far side of the Moon(**位于离地球远的地方**), it can only be seen from the space

4. Here is an image of what we will call SPA Basin

=> Here is an image of,.. we'll call **it the** SPA Basin

5. This colored image of the SPA Basin, though these are their actual colors, from midnight of American space probing 

=> This **color-coated** i* actual colors obviously, this image is from **mid-90s**, from the American **spacecraft** called **Clementine**. 

6. Unlike early spacecrafts, Clementine didn't orbit only around the Moon's equator.

=> Unlike early **lunar missions**, Clementine didn't orbit only around the Moon's equator.


7. Furthermore, if the water ice is mixed in the rocks and dust, it will be protected from radiation.

=> Furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in **with** rocks and dust, it would be protected from **evaporation**.


8. So, are you saying that there might be primitive life on the Moon?

=> So, are you saying there might be primitive life on the Moon?


9. That would be a very critical value for future Moon crator astronauts.

=> That would be **of** very **practical** value for future Moon **base** **for** astronauts.


10. water ice could be melted for drinking.

=> water ice could be melted **and purified** for drinking.

11. It can also be broken down into its own composition part, oxygen and hydrogen.

=> It **could** also be broken down into its **component** **parts**, oxygen and hydrogen.

12. Oxygen could be used to breathe, hydrogen could be turned into fuels, rock fuels.

=> Oxygen could be used to breathe, **and** hydrogen could be turned into fuels, **rocket** 13.asfuels.

13. Also, data from later missions indicates the significant concentrations of hydrogen, and water a meter underground at the pole.

=> Also, data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and **by inference** water **less than** a meter underground at **both** poles.


14. So water ice could enable the creation of sal stan of moon mine cap a 


=> So water ice could enable the creation of a **self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration**.


15. But taking tons of equiment to he moon to build life system in the moon, wouldn't that be too expensive?

=> But **hauling** tons of equiment to the moon to **make fuel and** build life **support** system **for a moon base**, wouldn't that be too expensive?

16. Permanent base may be a waste off, but we shouldn't aware of that.

=> Permanent base may be a **ways** off, but we shouldn't **have to wait for** that. 


17. The dust at the bottom of the SPA basin, really does have a lot of fascinating stories to tell.

=> The dust at the bottom of the SPA basin, really does have a fascinating story to tell.
