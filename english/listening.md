### Moon Landing
1. `But there is compeling reason in favor of another moon landing, which try to pinpoint the age of the moon.`

But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing, **not the least of which** is trying to **pinpoint** the moon's age.

2. `We could do this in theory, known as South pole basin.`

We could do this **in theory** by studying an **enormous** **impact crater**, known as the **South Pole-Aitken Basin**.

3. But since it's far side of the Moon, it can only be seen from the space

=> But since it's **on the** far side of the Moon(**位于离地球远的地方**), it can only be seen from the space

4. Here is an image of what we will call SPA Basin

=> Here is an image of,.. we'll call **it the** SPA Basin

5. This colored image of the SPA Basin, though these are their actual colors, from midnight of American space probing 

=> This **color-coated** i* actual colors obviously, this image is from **mid-90s**, from the American **spacecraft** called **Clementine**. 

6. Unlike early spacecrafts, Clementine didn't orbit only around the Moon's equator.

=> Unlike early **lunar missions**, Clementine didn't orbit only around the Moon's equator.


7. Furthermore, if the water ice is mixed in the rocks and dust, it will be protected from radiation.

=> Furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in **with** rocks and dust, it would be protected from **evaporation**.


8. So, are you saying that there might be primitive life on the Moon?

=> So, are you saying there might be primitive life on the Moon?


9. That would be a very critical value for future Moon crator astronauts.

=> That would be **of** very **practical** value for future Moon **base** **for** astronauts.


10. water ice could be melted for drinking.

=> water ice could be melted **and purified** for drinking.

11. It can also be broken down into its own composition part, oxygen and hydrogen.

=> It **could** also be broken down into its **component** **parts**, oxygen and hydrogen.

12. Oxygen could be used to breathe, hydrogen could be turned into fuels, rock fuels.

=> Oxygen could be used to breathe, **and** hydrogen could be turned into fuels, **rocket** 13.asfuels.

13. Also, data from later missions indicates the significant concentrations of hydrogen, and water a meter underground at the pole.

=> Also, data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and **by inference** water **less than** a meter underground at **both** poles.


14. So water ice could enable the creation of sal stan of moon mine cap a 


=> So water ice could enable the creation of a **self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration**.


15. But taking tons of equiment to he moon to build life system in the moon, wouldn't that be too expensive?

=> But **hauling** tons of equiment to the moon to **make fuel and** build life **support** system **for a moon base**, wouldn't that be too expensive?

16. Permanent base may be a waste off, but we shouldn't aware of that.

=> Permanent base may be a **ways** off, but we shouldn't **have to wait for** that. 


17. The dust at the bottom of the SPA basin, really does have a lot of fascinating stories to tell.

=> The dust at the bottom of the SPA basin, really does have a fascinating story to tell.



## 2. Architecture
### Cape Cod House
1. `Today we are taking a little deto of grand part architecture reso design architecture in the United States`

Today we are taking a little **detour** from the grand styles of public architecture we've been stduying to look at **residential architecture** in the United States

2. `Since this is sth we can all identify with, and I think it will help us see the relation between the function of structure and its style or form`

6. `For those who do not know the region, Cape Cod persists in the northeast coast land, so many houses in the particular sytle were built, that the name of the place became the name of the style.`


For those of you who do not know the northeast coast region, Cape Cod **is a peninsular**, a narrow **strip of land** that **juts out into the Atlantic**, and so many houses in this particular sytle were built on Cape Cod, that the name of the place became the name of the style.


7. `Notice how the house sit the low ground.`

Notice how the house **is** **fairly** low to the ground.

8. `The relatively low campact struture help the building stand the wind from the ocean.`

This relatively low **compact** struture helps the house **withstand** the strong winds blowing off the ocean.

9. `And look at the slope of the roof, the angle helps to rid water and snow that accumulates in the winter`

And look at the **slope of the roof**, the **steep** angle helps to keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter


10. `Seaside house also has very few decoration that is also typical of Cape Cod houses.`

Now see how the house has very little **exterior decoration** that is also typical of early Cape Cod houses.

11. `Not only the wind is one reason, not blowing off the decoration, there might be other reason, the New England region's custom`

The wind was one reason, **nothing sticking out** might **blow away** in the harsh weather,but there was probabably another reason, not related to the climate, more **reflection** of a **rural** New England society back then.

12. `You see, Cape Cod house isn't built in a big city, where all rich ppeple live there.`
You see, Cape Cod houses **were** not built in the big cities, where all the rich ppeple lived **back then**.

13. `This were modest `
This were modest **dwellings**.

14. `The people who built them simple could not afford large of expensive and decorated details`

So all these help to create an attitude of **conformity** in the community, and you can see why a modest, a very plain sytle would become so widely **imitated** thoughout rural New England.

18. `Good point. As it can apple, it's peality poposion enjoys wide popularity.`
Good point. and in fact it's precisely that as **aesthetic** appeal, the purity, the nearly perfect **proportions** of the house...that's another reason for the Cape Cod's **enduring** popularity.
