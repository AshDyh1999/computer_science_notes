### Moon Landing
1. `But there is compeling reason in favor of another moon landing, which try to pinpoint the age of the moon.`

But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing, **not the least of which** is trying to **pinpoint** the moon's age.

2. `We could do this in theory, known as South pole basin.`

We could do this **in theory** by studying an **enormous** **impact crater**, known as the **South Pole-Aitken Basin**.

3. But since it's far side of the Moon, it can only be seen from the space

10. water ice could be melted for drinking.

=> water ice could be melted **and purified** for drinking.

11. It can also be broken down into its own composition part, oxygen and hydrogen.

=> It **could** also be broken down into its **component** **parts**, oxygen and hydrogen.

12. Oxygen could be used to breathe, hydrogen could be turned into fuels, rock fuels.

=> Oxygen could be used to breathe, **and** hydrogen could be turned into fuels, **rocket** 13.asfuels.

13. Also, data from later missions indicates the significant concentrations of hydrogen, and water a meter underground at the pole.

=> Also, data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and **by inference** water **less than** a meter underground at **both** poles.


14. So water ice could enable the creation of sal stan of moon mine cap a 


=> So water ice could enable the creation of a **self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration**.


15. But taking tons of equiment to he moon to build life system in the moon, wouldn't that be too expensive?

=> But **hauling** tons of equiment to the moon to **make fuel and** build life **support** system **for a moon base**, wouldn't that be too expensive?

16. Permanent base may be a waste off, but we shouldn't aware of that.

=> Permanent base may be a **ways** off, but we shouldn't **have to wait for** that. 


17. The dust at the bottom of the SPA basin, really does have a lot of fascinating stories to tell.

### Difficulties in Astronomy
1. `Isn't it strange that the Milky Way is within our xxx, but we haven't seen it?`

3. `This is irony, the building is here, and the unshielded lights are there...`

Now here is an irony, the building we are in now, the astronomy building not far from the obversatory, has unshield lights.


4. `It's basically beyond our control, especially our night sky and `

7. `There is price or progress, uh?`

There is a price **for** progress, eh?


8. `Let's think beyond light pollution, that's only one technology advances that interferes with astronomy research`

Let's think beyond light pollution, that's only one kind of technological advances that has interfered with **astronomical** research


9. `We don't always get information by looking at the stars. For the periods of 17 years ago, we use radio which lets us to study radio rays from the sky`

9. `We don't always get information by looking at the stars. For the periods of 17 years ago, we use radio which lets us to study radio rays from the sky`
We don't **only** gain information by looking at the stars. For the **past 70 years or so**, we have also used radio **astronomy**, which lets us to study radio **waves** from the sky

10. `What we see from earth is actually electronical from the sun.`

What we are seeing from earth is actually electronmagnetic radiation that's coming from stars.

11. `When phone times come right way, and hits the object in the atmosphere, water drops the nitrogen and hitrogen, and so on`


When **photons** and light waves hit objects in our atmosphere, water **droplets**, oxygen and nitrogen molecules, **dust particles** and so on.

## 2. Architecture
### Cape Cod House
1. `Today we are taking a little deto of grand part architecture reso design architecture in the United States`

Today we are taking a little **detour** from the grand styles of public architecture we've been stduying to look at **residential architecture** in the United States

2. `Since this is sth we can all identify with, and I think it will help us see the relation between the function of structure and its style or form`

Since this is sth we can all identify with, I think it will help us see the **relationship** between the function of structure and its style or form

But it first showed up in US **northeast**, **in the New England region**, around the late 1600s.

6. `For those who do not know the region, Cape Cod persists in the northeast coast land, so many houses in the particular sytle were built, that the name of the place became the name of the style.`


For those of you who do not know the northeast coast region, Cape Cod **is a peninsular**, a narrow **strip of land** that **juts out into the Atlantic**, and so many houses in this particular sytle were built on Cape Cod, that the name of the place became the name of the style.

18. `Good point. As it can apple, it's peality poposion enjoys wide popularity.`
Good point. and in fact it's precisely that as **aesthetic** appeal, the purity, the nearly perfect **proportions** of the house...that's another reason for the Cape Cod's **enduring** popularity.



## 3. botany
### Plants in salt marshes
1. `Ok, today we are going to talk about plants in salt marshes in North America.`

The water is salty, there is **litte** shade, and the ocean **tide** comes in and out, constantly flooding the marsh, so the variety of plants found in salt marshes is limited, but there is a plant **genus** that **thrives** there, the Spartina
