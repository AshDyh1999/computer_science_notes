    Secondly, field trips enable students to recharge their batteries. 
    It is known to all that students have to complete a large number of assignments and thus suffer from intense pressure. Since it is common for students to be confronted with academic pressure, providing them with the opportunities of direct access to the outside world has a positive impact on their study. 
    For instance, my friend used to study at classroom to prepare for physical exam for a long time without participating in recreational activities. Because of the lack of the exercise, he felt sick on the day of the exam, and thus failed to earn high score. However, if he took a break from normal routines and went on field trips to have a relax, he was bound to achieve high academic performance in the physical exams.
