1. A和B对立,证明A正确
    1. 为什么主题句是对的?
    2. 主题句和原题有什么关系?
2. A和B不完全相反,A更好
    1. 


#### conjunction
1. 这是因为\_\_\_: 使用在 "<主题句> + \_\_\_ + <为什么主题句是正确的?>"
+ `The reason is that ___`
+ `This is because ___`



2. 2句解释: 使用在 "<为什么主题句是正确的>"有2句的情况下
    1. 进一步解释
    + `In other words, ___`
    + `To be more specific, ___`
    + `This means that ___`
    + `___, meaning that ___`

    2. 并列的两点法
    + `For one thing, ___. For another, ___`





3. 因为\_\_\_(改写主题句), 所以\_\_\_(改写原题): 使用在 "<为什么主题句是正确的?> + \_\_\_ + <主题句和原题有什么关系?>"
+ `Because of/ Due to + 名词, ___`
+ `Because/ Since + 句子, ___`
+ `Therefore,/ Thus,/ As a result, ___`
+ `In this way, ___` (这样的话)









### 2-3. 举例
1. 为什么这个例子会导致主题句?
2. 为什么这样会导致原题?
#### NOTE:
1. 泛、笼统、抽象 => 具体: 不要泛泛而谈

+ 人: I / my father / uncle / brother / friend / classmate /English teacher / in my family
+ 学科: in a language / history / math / biology class
+ 专业: English / business / science / art majors
+ 学校: in my high school / at my university
+ 城市、国家: in the city / country where I live / in China
+ 职业:teachers / business people / computer engineers
+ 时间:a week / half a year
+ 金额:1000 dollars / the annual income of an average family

2. 过去的例子注意使用过去时

3. 简短, 2~3句话, 不讲故事

4. 扣紧主题句和原题,不要写无关的内容

5. <为什么这样会导致原题?>时,最好具体一点.比如"提高邻里关系",可以写成"对邻里有疏远感"类似的.

#### 思路
1. 职业强无敌: 我的谁谁谁是做什么的,所以就会导致主题句的情况.我们就发生了原题的情况.

#### conjunction
1. 比如说: "<说理:主题句和原题有什么关系> \_\_\_ <举例>"
+ `For example, ___`
+ `For instance, ___`
+ `To give a clear example, ___`
+ `To illustrate, ___`



### 2-4. 对比
1. 有今昔对比的最好简明对比一下


### 3. 让步段
It is true that <反方观点可能有道理>. However, <简单地总结前2个explanation,并逻辑反驳>. Therefore, I still hold the view that <重申观点>




## problems
1. 没有时间做某事

## 范例
4. recharge batteries and get refreshed and energetic / feel overwhelmed / feel less overwhelmed
    > Secondly, field trips enable students to recharge their batteries. 
    > It is known to all that students have to complete a large number of assignments and thus suffer from intense pressure. Since it is common for students to be confronted with academic pressure, providing them with the opportunities of direct access to the outside world has a positive impact on their study. 
    > For instance, my friend used to study at classroom to prepare for physical exam for a long time without participating in recreational activities. Because of the lack of the exercise, he felt sick on the day of the exam, and thus failed to earn high score. However, if he took a break from normal routines and went on field trips to have a relax, he was bound to achieve high academic performance in the physical exams.
