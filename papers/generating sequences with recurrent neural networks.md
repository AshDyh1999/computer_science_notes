## Objectiveness
Demonstrate that LSTM can be used for complex sequences generation by predicting online handwriting.

## Points
+ The point is defined as (x, y, s), where s represents the state of the point. In other words, if this point is the end of the stroke, then s is equal to 1, otherwise it is equal to 0.
